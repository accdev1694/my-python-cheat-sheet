# Python documentation is docs.python.org/3/library


# This is how to interpret the docs, for example the print function:

# print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush-False)

# Here, its starts with the opening and closed parenthesis.

# Everything within those parenthesis are the parameters
# and while using them, you pass them as aguments

# The first parameter *objects means the print function can take any nnumber of objects as parameters
# you can pass in strings, numbers, booleans, variables predefined, all seperated by commas

list = ['fruits', 'houses']
print(1, "orange", True, list)

# the sep parameter set to sep=' ' means python automatically adds single blank spaces to seperate each parameter, when you use the comma seperators

# the end='\n' means by default python ends every new line with a new line
