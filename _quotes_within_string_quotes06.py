# you can specify quotation marks within a the quotes in a string of text by using two methods

# 1.) use another variant of quotes
print('hello, "friend"') # or
print("hello, 'friend'")

# 02.) use an escape character
print('hello, \'guys\'')
# this tells python interpreter that the use of the inner quotes is to be taken literally and get it printed
