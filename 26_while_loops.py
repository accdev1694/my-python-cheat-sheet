# while loops are used to repead some code over and over until you break out of the code
# lets print hello 5 times
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Hello")
    count += 1
    
# while count is less than 5 you keep printing hello
# then add 1 to count
# the momment count becomes more than 5 you break out of the loop
